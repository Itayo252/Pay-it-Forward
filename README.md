# Pay-it-Forward

This is an app developed as a 5-points CS project in highschool.

The app is an imitation of the popular "Bit" app in Isreal, the diffrence is that you transfer debt and not actual money from one bank account to another.
The vision behind the app is to allow debt cancellation, bypasses and chain simplifications in the vast network of transfers.
